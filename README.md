Most of us have been huge fans of Pokemon since childhood. I have made a very simple and fun React project using PokeAPI. Here we can fetch the Pokemon details or their characteristics through this API. We can also make different cards for each Pokemon and on each card show their pictures, their names, etc. There is a “read more” button on a Pokemon card, and by clicking that button, users will get to know more things about each Pokemon.
